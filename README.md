# FailyV-Weazel-News-Checker
!UNOFFICIAL PROJECT!

This little Python script will allow you to check if there is a new Weazel News article (https://panel.failyv.com/weazelnews/).

When you want to run it the first time, make sure you modify the Webhook url* (line 4 in config part), so that the notification of new articles appear in the right discord server.

When the messages are sent, you can also click on the name of the author of the article and this will send you to his wiki page (may not be functional yet).

*If you don't now how to create a webhook in Discord :
1. Click the gear icon (Edit Channel) of the channel you want to post to.
2. Click Webhooks in the left menu.
3. Click the Create Webhook button.
4. Enter a Name of your choice.
5. Click the Copy button of the Webhook URL.
6. Click the Save button.
