# FailyV-Weazel-News-Checker
!UNOFFICIAL PROJECT!

This little Python script will allow you to check if there is a new Weazel News article (https://panel.failyv.com/weazelnews/).

When you want to run it the first time, make sure you modify the Webhook url (line 36), so that the notification of new articles appear in the right discord server.

When the messages are sent, you can also click on the name of the author of the article and this will send you to his wiki page (may not be functional yet).
